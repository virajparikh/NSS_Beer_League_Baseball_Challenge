Layout
Form
Standings after each week


Phase 1:
Use Bootstrap
Create a modal form
Team Name
Fname
Lname
Phone # - validation
Sponsor
Zip Code - validation (use 3)


var Team = new Object [TeamName, MgrFirstName, MgrLastName, Phone, Sponsor, Zip]

min - 4  - text with validation “3 teams still available”
max - 8  - “League is now full”


Formatting - Bootstrap
use Tables

Week 0: 
everyone starts off 0-0

Week 1:
Hit Update Results
Capture scores for each game


Issues:
“Add a Team” button viewable to anyone
“Update Results” button - should only be viewable by commissioner??


Loop through scores each week

Game 1: 
Team1score
Team2score
Team1win
Team2loss

if Team1score > Team2score, 
then Team1Win + 1 && Team2Loss + 1, 
else Team1Loss + 1 && Team2Win + 1
